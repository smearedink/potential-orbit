potential-orbit
===============

Watch the trajectory of a test particle in a made-up galactic potential!
(It's logarithmic, and is eq 3.103 of Binney and Tremaine's Galactic Dynamics 2nd Ed. if you're curious.)

Now features surface-of-section drawing!

Requires the delightful pygame module.

The parameters can be changed in the file porbit_init.dat.

Controls:

 Q or ESC: quit

 SPACEBAR: pause

 UP/DOWN ARROWS: speed up or slow down simulation

 C: clear trails

 T: turn trails off/on entirely

Click on the surface of section to switch to a different orbit with the same energy.  Cool!
